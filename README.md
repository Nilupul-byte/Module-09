# Module 2 Redone â€“ Upgradeable Smart Contracts with God Mode NFT

This project includes three upgradeable smart contracts built with Hardhat and OpenZeppelin Upgrades:
- An ERC721 NFT contract (initial + upgraded with god mode)
- An ERC20 token contract
- A staking contract

## Features

- **Upgradeable Contracts**: All contracts are deployed as upgradeable proxies.
- **ERC721 God Mode**: The upgraded version of the NFT includes a `godModeTransfer` function, allowing the contract owner to forcibly transfer NFTs between accounts.
- **Deployment via Hardhat**
- **Etherscan Verification**: Both the initial and upgraded versions are visible on Etherscan.
